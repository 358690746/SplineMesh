# SplineMesh

Inspired by Unreal Engine 4 spline component, SplineMesh is a Unity plugin allowing creation of curved content :
 - a bezier curve editor
 - complete math toolset for coordinates and tangents
 - a mesh deformer
 - a shape extruder
 - exemple contents
 
Spline component is independant and can be used for anything like camera motion.

## How to use it
Add the Spline component to an empty object and draw you spline by dragging nodes and directions. Keyboard shortcuts and more are visible in the editor.

Add an exemple like Tentacle or Pipe to get some deformed mesh, inspire from their source code to build your own.

Shape extruder exemple comes with it's own editor for 2d shape drawing.

## How to contribute
SplineMesh is release freely and open-source. The author consider that such a feature should be available to all.

You can contribute by buying the paid version of SplineMesh, which contains nothing more

You can also contribute to the code itself by sending code or your own exemple components.
